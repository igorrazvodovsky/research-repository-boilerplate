# Knowledge

_Synthesised insights, patterns, and actionable principles_

Distills information into knowledge — reusable insights, patterns, and principles that compound over time.

## What goes here

### Strategic insights
- **High-level findings** - Key discoveries that shape product strategy
- **User behaviour patterns** - Recurring behavioural patterns across studies
- **Mental model maps** - How users conceptualise your domain
- **Decision frameworks** - Principles for making design decisions

### User understanding
- **Personas** - Rich user archetypes based on research
- **Journey maps** - End-to-end user experience documentation
- **Segmentation models** - How and why your users differ
- **Jobs-to-be-done** - What users are trying to accomplish and why

### Design principles
- **Product principles** - Guidelines derived from user needs
- **Best practices** - Validated approaches from your research
- **Anti-patterns** - What to avoid (with evidence why)
- **Success metrics** - How to measure if you're meeting user needs

### Knowledge base
- **Research methodologies** - Approaches that worked (or didn't) for your context
- **Lessons learnt** - Meta-knowledge about doing research in your organisation
- **Hypothesis library** - Validated/invalidated assumptions for future reference
- **Pattern catalogue** - Reusable interaction patterns with user evidence

## From information to knowledge

Create lasting value:
- **Synthesise across** multiple studies to find patterns
- **Generalise insights** that apply beyond single projects
- **Create frameworks** for decision-making
- **Document principles** that guide future work
- **Build mental models** of your users and domain

## The compounding effect

Knowledge accumulates and gains value over time:
- Each study adds to understanding
- Patterns become clearer with more evidence
- Principles become more refined
- New research validates or challenges existing knowledge

## Feeding back to design-kit

Knowledge here becomes:
- Training data for AI tools across design-kit
- Source material for templates and examples
- Context that makes future research faster
- Organisational memory that survives team changes

## Cross-project insights

Tag knowledge with:
- **Domains** - Which product areas it applies to
- **User types** - Which segments it's relevant for
- **Confidence level** - How strongly supported by evidence
- **Recency** - When last validated
- **Source studies** - Which research projects contributed

## Synthesis

- Link to multiple sources
- Document confidence and evidence strength
- Use consistent taxonomy across documents
- Make relationships explicit

## Questions knowledge answers

- _"Why do users behave this way?"_
- _"What should we do about it?"_
- _"What have we learnt that applies elsewhere?"_
- _"What patterns keep emerging across studies?"_

_"Why and how should we apply this?"_ → Knowledge answers these questions.

**Data** → Raw facts (_What happened?_)
↓
**Information** → Organised, contextualised (_What does it mean?_)
↓
**Knowledge** → Insights, patterns, principles (_Why and how should we apply it?_)
↓
**Wisdom** → Good judgement in applying knowledge (lives in people, informed by this repository)
