# Knowledge

_Synthesized insights, patterns, and actionable principles_

This directory distills information into knowledge — the reusable insights, patterns, and principles that compound over time and inform future work.

## What Goes Here

### Strategic Insights
- **High-level findings** - Key discoveries that shape product strategy
- **User behavior patterns** - Recurring behavioral patterns across studies
- **Mental model maps** - How users conceptualize your domain
- **Decision frameworks** - Principles for making design decisions

### User Understanding
- **Personas** - Rich user archetypes based on research
- **Journey maps** - End-to-end user experience documentation
- **Segmentation models** - How and why your users differ
- **Jobs-to-be-done** - What users are trying to accomplish and why

### Design Principles
- **Product principles** - Guidelines derived from user needs
- **Best practices** - Validated approaches from your research
- **Anti-patterns** - What to avoid (with evidence why)
- **Success metrics** - How to measure if you're meeting user needs

### Knowledge Base
- **Research methodologies** - Approaches that worked (or didn't) for your context
- **Lessons learned** - Meta-knowledge about doing research in your organization
- **Hypothesis library** - Validated/invalidated assumptions for future reference
- **Pattern catalog** - Reusable interaction patterns with user evidence

## From Information to Knowledge

This is where you create lasting value:
- **Synthesize across** multiple studies to find patterns
- **Generalize insights** that apply beyond single projects
- **Create frameworks** for decision-making
- **Document principles** that guide future work
- **Build mental models** of your users and domain

## The Compounding Effect

Knowledge accumulates and gains value over time:
- Each study adds to your understanding
- Patterns become clearer with more evidence
- Principles become more refined
- New research can validate or challenge existing knowledge

## Feeding Back to design-kit

Knowledge here becomes:
- Training data for AI tools across design-kit
- Source material for templates and examples
- Context that makes future research faster and better
- Organizational memory that survives team changes

## Cross-Project Insights

Tag knowledge with:
- **Domains** - Which product areas it applies to
- **User types** - Which segments it's relevant for
- **Confidence level** - How strongly supported by evidence
- **Recency** - When last validated
- **Source studies** - Which research projects contributed

## Synthesis

- Link to multiple sources
- Document confidence and evidence strength
- Use consistent taxonomy across documents
- Make relationships explicit

## Questions Knowledge Answers

- _"Why do users behave this way?"_
- _"What should we do about it?"_
- _"What have we learned that applies elsewhere?"_
- _"What patterns keep emerging across studies?"_

Think: _"Why and how should we apply this?"_ → Knowledge answers these questions.

**Data** → Raw facts (_What happened?_)
↓
**Information** → Organized, contextualized (_What does it mean?_)
↓
**Knowledge** → Insights, patterns, principles (_Why and how should we apply it?_)
