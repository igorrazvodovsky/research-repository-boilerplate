name: reframing
description: Deliberately shift perspective on problems to reveal new possibilities and constraints. This skill should be used when users feel stuck with conventional solutions, problems seem over-constrained, solutions feel incremental rather than innovative, users explicitly ask to "think differently" or "see this another way", or current approaches yield diminishing returns. Requires sensemaking-synthesis skill as foundation.

# Reframing

## Purpose

Provide methods to deliberately shift perspective on problems, revealing new possibilities and constraints. Reframing allows escaping cognitive fixation and helps users see their challenges from radically different angles by systematically exploring alternative frames across entity, context, and embodiment dimensions.

## When to Use

Apply this skill when:
- Users feel stuck with conventional solutions
- Problems seem over-constrained
- Solutions feel incremental rather than innovative
- Users explicitly ask to "think differently" or "see this another way"
- Current approaches yield diminishing returns
- Users request fresh perspectives after initial sensemaking

## Prerequisites

This skill builds on **sensemaking-synthesis**. Use sensemaking first to understand the problem space, then apply reframing to shift perspectives.

## Core Frame Components

Every frame consists of three elements:
- **Entity** - The actor or experiencer (who/what)
- **Context** - The setting and circumstances (where/when/why)
- **Embodiment** - The specific solution/system/approach (how)

## Systematic Reframing Method

### Step 1: Identify Current Frame

First, articulate the implicit frame the user is operating within:

```
The current frame appears to be:
- Entity: [Who the user assumes is the actor]
- Context: [The assumed setting/constraints]
- Embodiment: [The assumed solution type]
```

### Step 2: Generate Alternative Frames

Create a reframing matrix exploring each dimension:

```
Let's shift perspectives:

ENTITY REFRAMES:
- Instead of [current entity], consider [alternative entity]
  → This reveals: [new insight or constraint]
- From the perspective of [different stakeholder]...
  → This highlights: [different priority or need]

CONTEXT REFRAMES:
- Rather than [current context], imagine this in [alternative context]
  → This changes: [key assumptions]
- If moved from [current] to [different setting/time/culture]...
  → This surfaces: [hidden possibilities]

EMBODIMENT REFRAMES:
- Instead of [current solution type], consider [alternative approach]
  → This enables: [new capabilities]
- If borrowed from [different domain]...
  → This suggests: [unexpected solution]
```

### Step 3: Explore Provocative Frames

Include "impossible" frames that break assumptions:

```
Here's a provocative reframe:
What if [seemingly absurd shift]?

While this might seem impractical, it reveals:
- [Assumption 1] isn't actually fixed
- [Constraint 2] might be self-imposed
- [Possibility 3] emerges when removing [assumption]
```

### Step 4: Synthesise Insights Across Frames

Combine insights from multiple reframes:

```
Combining these perspectives:
- From [Frame 1]: [Insight A]
- From [Frame 2]: [Insight B]
- From [Frame 3]: [Insight C]

SYNTHESIS: [Novel solution incorporating multiple frame insights]
```

## Example Application

**User Problem:** "How can we improve employee onboarding?"

```
CURRENT FRAME:
- Entity: HR department
- Context: First week of employment, office setting
- Embodiment: Training sessions and paperwork

REFRAME 1 - Entity Shift (New Employee):
From the new employee's perspective, onboarding is about reducing anxiety and finding belonging. This suggests focusing on social integration over information transfer.

REFRAME 2 - Context Shift (Continuous Process):
What if onboarding wasn't a discrete event but a 6-month journey? This reveals opportunities for gradual complexity increase and milestone celebrations.

REFRAME 3 - Embodiment Shift (Gaming):
Borrowing from video game tutorials - what if onboarding was a quest system with achievements? This could make compliance engaging and progress visible.

PROVOCATIVE REFRAME - No Onboarding:
What if employees started contributing immediately with no formal onboarding? This reveals that perhaps we're over-protecting new hires and under-utilising their fresh perspective.

SYNTHESIS:
Create a "reverse mentoring" programme where new employees immediately begin teaching others about their domain expertise while learning company culture through collaborative projects. Gamify compliance elements but emphasise real contribution from day one.
```

## Reframing Triggers

Listen for these cues to activate reframing:
- "We've always done it this way"
- "There's no other option"
- "Our constraints are..."
- "The problem is..."
- "We need a fresh perspective"
- "I'm stuck"

## Key Behaviours

### DO:
- Make the current frame explicit before shifting
- Include both practical and provocative reframes
- Show how each reframe reveals something hidden
- Connect reframes to actionable insights
- Respect domain expertise while challenging assumptions

### DON'T:
- Reframe just for novelty's sake
- Ignore genuine constraints
- Dismiss the current frame as wrong
- Provide reframes without explaining their value
- Overwhelm with too many perspectives at once

## Output Format

When reframing, structure responses as:

1. Acknowledge current frame
2. Introduce 3-5 alternative frames
3. Include one provocative frame
4. Synthesise insights
5. Suggest concrete next steps

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill serves as the middle step in the cascade:
- **sensemaking-synthesis** (prerequisite) - Provides initial understanding
- **arthur-combinatorial** (child skill) - Technology-specific reframing

When reframing technological systems, proceed to arthur-combinatorial for deeper analysis.

## Quality Markers

Reframing is effective when:
- Users experience "aha" moments
- Previously invisible options become apparent
- Constraints transform into features
- Problems reshape into opportunities
- Discussion shifts from "whether" to "how"
