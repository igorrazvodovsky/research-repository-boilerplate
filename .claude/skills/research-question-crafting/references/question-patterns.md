# Question patterns

## Decision-led
- "What do we need to learn about [audience] in [context] to decide [decision]?"
- "How do [audience] currently [behavior] in [context], and what informs [decision]?"

## Outcome-led
- "What prevents [audience] from achieving [outcome] in [context], and which constraints matter most?"
- "How do [audience] define success for [task] in [context], and what tradeoffs would they accept?"

## Comparative
- "Which approach helps [audience] achieve [outcome] more reliably in [context], and why?"
- "How do [audience] choose between [option A] and [option B] today, and what shapes that choice?"

## Example rewrites
- Draft: "Will users like the new onboarding?"
  - Better: "How do first-time admins experience the new onboarding flow, and where do they get stuck so we can decide which steps to redesign?"

- Draft: "Should we build feature X?"
  - Better: "What problems are ops managers trying to solve during [process], and which unmet needs would justify building feature X?"

- Draft: "Is the pricing acceptable?"
  - Better: "How do procurement leads evaluate price vs. risk for [product], and what thresholds influence a purchase decision?"
