# Information

_Organised, tagged, and contextualised research data_

Transforms raw data into meaningful, structured information through analysis and organisation.

## What goes here

### Interview analysis
- **Tagged excerpts** - Key quotes and observations organised by theme/tag
- **Question-answer mappings** - Responses organised by research question
- **Tag taxonomy** - Categorisation scheme for coding responses
- **Pattern documentation** - Recurring themes identified across sessions

### User needs
- **Original user needs** - Needs as expressed by participants
- **Refined user needs** - Standardised format: "As a [who] [context], I need [need] so that [outcome]"
- **Need categorisation** - Organised by theme, journey stage, priority
- **Traceability matrix** - Links needs back to source interviews

### Research findings
- **Evidence-based findings** - Specific discoveries with supporting data
- **Hypothesis validation** - Research questions answered with evidence
- **Journey stage mapping** - Where findings apply in user journey
- **Segmentation analysis** - How findings differ across user types

### Synthesis documents
- **Affinity maps** - Thematic grouping of observations
- **Mental models** - How users think about the domain
- **Pain points catalogue** - Documented frustrations with evidence
- **Opportunity areas** - Gaps and potential improvements identified

## From data to information

Add context and meaning:
- **Tag and code** raw interview data
- **Categorise and group** related observations
- **Refine and standardise** user needs
- **Link evidence** to findings
- **Map relationships** between different research elements

## Cross-referencing

Use unique IDs to maintain traceability:
- Link findings to source data: `[USR001]`, `[Interview 2024-01-15]`
- Connect needs to hypotheses: `[HYP03]`, `[RQ-12]`
- Reference journey stages: `[Discovery]`, `[Evaluation]`

## Analysis

- Consistent tagging across documents
- Explicit links between related concepts
- Metadata-rich frontmatter
- Standardised user story format

## Moving up the hierarchy

Input for:
- **Knowledge** (synthesised insights, patterns, principles)

_"What does it mean?"_ → Information answers this question.
