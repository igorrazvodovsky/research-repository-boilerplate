## Archive Note

This need was merged with "understand who has access" (ID 125) during the October 2025 needs refinement.

**Rationale**: Both needs addressed understanding access and permissions in collaborative contexts with nearly identical outcomes ("collaborate safely" vs "know who can see and interact"). The merged need now captures both aspects: who has access AND what they can do.
