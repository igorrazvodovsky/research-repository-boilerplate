Frames are reusable lenses for structuring research and synthesis across DIKW levels. Pair them with the framing skill (`skills/framing.md`) to pick the right lens, scope questions, and produce consistent outputs.

## How to use with the framing skill

- Humans: open `skills/framing.md`, follow the checklist to choose frames, and note which DIKW level you are transitioning from/to. Capture the selected frame links at the top of your note for traceability.
- LLMs: read `skills/framing.md` and announce which frame(s) you are applying. Echo the chosen DIKW transition (e.g., data → information) and the target note path before generating content.
- For both: validate links resolve in Obsidian (`[[methods/frames/<frame>]]`) and cite sources from lower DIKW levels.

## Example: 25-Q4 Tacton domains

The plan in `projects/25-Q4 Tacton domains in user-centered terms.md` pulls three frames:
- [[decision]] to map domain decisions.
- [[dynamics]] to understand flow, accumulation, and feedback.
- [[boundary-objects]] to align interpretations of artifacts.

When adding domain notes under `3-knowledge/`, reuse these frames via wiki-links and show how each frame bridges the prior level (e.g., decisions grounded in `2-information/` interview notes).
