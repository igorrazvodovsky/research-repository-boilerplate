# Boundary objects frame

You treat the domain as a set of shared artefacts that different groups use in different ways to coordinate work. These artefacts are “boundary objects”: flexible enough to mean different things to different people, but structured enough to keep them loosely aligned.

What becomes primary
- Boundary objects – artefacts that cross team or role boundaries: quotes, proposals, configuration models, BOMs, pricing rules, product catalogues, requirement specs, tickets, roadmaps.
- Interpretations – how each group reads and uses the same artefact: sales vs engineering vs finance vs customer.
- Transformations – how artefacts change shape or fidelity as they move: from discovery notes → rough configuration → formal quote → contract.
- Tensions and mismatches – where different interpretations collide: “They thought this meant X, we meant Y.”

When to use this frame
- You’re interested in cross-functional collaboration and handoffs.
- You see lots of documents, models, or screens passed around between teams.
- Problems often show up as “miscommunication,” “wrong expectations,” or “the customer thought we promised X.”

Guiding questions for the researcher
- Which artefacts are shared between different roles or organizations?
For each artefact:
- Who creates it, who modifies it, who reads it, who approves it?
- What job does it do for each actor (e.g., evidence, negotiation tool, formal commitment)?
- What parts of it are stable, and what parts are constantly reinterpreted or rewritten?
- Where do people translate between artefacts (e.g., from engineering model to sales-friendly quote)?
- Where do misunderstandings cluster around the same object (e.g., line items, options, terms)?
- Are there missing boundary objects—places where people hack together their own spreadsheets, screenshots, or slides?

What you pay attention to / collect
- Copies or screenshots of real artefacts across the process (early drafts, final versions, internal vs external views).
- Observations of how people talk around and through an artefact: pointing, explaining, annotating, ignoring certain fields.
- Differences in language between groups describing the same object.
- Evidence of versioning issues, double entry, or “personal copies.”

How this frame changes your research moves
- You explicitly ask to see artefacts (“Can you show me the last quote you sent?” “What does the engineering spec look like?”).
- In sessions, you treat artefacts as conversation anchors and ask each role: “What does this object do for you?”, “Which parts do you trust / not trust?”
- In synthesis, insights are about improving or reimagining boundary objects: clearer shared objects, layered views for different actors, better transitions between artefacts, or introducing new boundary objects where gaps exist.
