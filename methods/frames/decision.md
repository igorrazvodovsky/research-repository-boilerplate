# Decision frame

You treat the domain as a web of decisions made by different actors under constraints. The focus is on what decisions people make, with what information, trade-offs, and consequences.

What becomes primary
- Decision points – moments where someone chooses between options: e.g., which configuration to propose, which discount to offer, whether to accept a risk, which quote to prioritize.
- Decision-makers and roles – who formally or informally makes or shapes the decision: sales rep, sales engineer, approver, buyer, legal, product, etc.
- Inputs to decisions – data, tools, policies, gut feelings.
- Criteria and trade-offs – what “good” looks like and what is sacrificed: speed vs accuracy, margin vs win probability, standardization vs flexibility.
- Outcomes – what happens because of the decision (for users, business, and the system).

When to use this frame
- You’re trying to understand how work actually gets done and why people behave the way they do, especially when they bend or bypass tools.
- You’re designing for complex workflows, approvals, or configuration/pricing in B2B systems.
- Stakeholders talk about “bad decisions,” “approval hell,” “we took a risk,” or “they chose the wrong thing.”

Guiding questions for the researcher
- What are the critical decisions people need to make in this domain?
For each decision:
- Who is involved?
- What information do they look at and what do they wish they had?
- What are they optimizing for (in their own words)?
- What are they afraid of (risks, blame, failure modes)?
- Which decisions are frequent and small, and which are rare but high impact?
- Where do decisions get stuck, get escalated, or get made “off-system” (spreadsheets, back channels, Slack)?
- How do people learn from past decisions (or fail to)?

What you pay attention to / collect
- Stories that include choice and justification (“We decided to… because…”).
- Conflict or misalignment between stated rules and actual practice.
- Evidence of shadow decision processes (workarounds, unofficial approvals).

How this frame changes your research moves
- You design research activities to surface decisions (think-aloud as they choose, “take me through your last tricky quote,” decision diaries).
- In synthesis, insights are framed as: “In decision X, people currently optimize for Y, constrained by Z.”, “Key failure mode: decision X is made without visibility into Y.”
- Design implications are about supporting or reshaping decisions: Better cues, guardrails, reversible choices, clearer accountability, or changing who decides what.
