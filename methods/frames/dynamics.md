# System dynamics frame

You treat the domain as a dynamic system: things accumulate and deplete (stocks), move or change (flows), and create reinforcing or balancing feedback loops over time. The focus is on patterns of change rather than isolated events.

What becomes primary
- Stocks – accumulated states, e.g., pipeline of open deals, number of valid configurations, trust between teams, technical debt, user knowledge.
- Flows – activities or processes that change those stocks, e.g., number of quotes generated per week, rate of approvals, changes to product data, onboarding sessions.
- Feedback loops – cycles that amplify or dampen effects, e.g., “More errors → more manual checks → slower quotes → more workarounds → even more errors.”

When to use this frame
- You’re doing foundational or domain research and care about how things evolve over time, not just “what happens in one session.”
- You suspect systemic problems (bottlenecks, delays, oscillations, chronic pain points).
- Stakeholders talk about “always being behind,” “firefighting,” “things piling up,” or “vicious cycles.”

Guiding questions for the researcher
- What are the key stocks in this domain (things that can accumulate: work, knowledge, risk, trust, money)?
- What flows increase or decrease each stock? Who controls those flows?
- Where do people describe vicious or virtuous cycles (“the more X, the more/less Y”)?
- Where do delays or lags show up (e.g., time to get approvals, time until data fixes show effects)?
- Which parts of the system are trying to stabilize things (rules, checks, policies) and which parts tend to escalate (targets, incentives, shortcuts)?

What you pay attention to / collect
- Narratives that span time (“Over a quarter…”, “After a while…”, “It always ends up…”).
- Diagrams of flows and loops (even rough whiteboard sketches).
- Metrics that naturally look like stocks/flows (backlog size, cycle time, frequency).
- Pain points that involve accumulation (queue of requests, growing complexity, rework).

How this frame changes your research moves
- In interviews, you ask “what happens next?” and “what happens if this keeps going?” instead of only “what happened this time?”
- In synthesis, you link observations into feedback loops rather than just listing issues.
- You frame insights as systemic levers (where we can change flows or loops), not just local fixes.
