# Research Repository Boilerplate

A starter template for UX research repositories that combines human readability with AI workflows. Part of the [design-kit](https://github.com/igorrazvodovsky/design-kit) project.

## Philosophy

This boilerplate attempts a **markdown-first approach** to research documentation, enabling:

- _Seamless AI collaboration_ - Work with Claude and other AI tools directly on your research artifacts
- _Human-friendly workflows_ - Use Obsidian for natural navigation and note-taking
- _Knowledge compounding_ - Build a repository that grows in value over time, feeding insights back into your broader design practice

## Structure
This is tentative—I’ll make it up as I go along.

### Templates
Ready-to-use research document templates organized by workflow phase:
- _Research Planning_ - Project checklists, sprint plans, hypothesis frameworks
- _Interviews_ - Discussion guides, consent forms, participant tracking
- _Analysis_ - Tag taxonomies, synthesis frameworks, coding templates
- _Outputs_ - User needs formats, persona templates, journey maps, final reports

### Examples

- TODO: Obsidian-compatibile transcript→highlight→insight flow
- TODO: Project-agnostic user needs
- ...

### Tools
Utilities that enhance human insight:
- Interview synthesis and pattern detection
- User needs extraction and categorization
- Cross-reference mapping (hypotheses → questions → findings)
- Tag-based analysis across multiple studies

### Knowledge Base
Accumulated insights and patterns that create compounding value over time

## Key Features

### Markdown-Native
Everything is markdown, making it:
- Version-controllable with git
- Searchable and linkable
- Compatible with other tools (Obsidian, VS Code, etc.)
- Perfect for AI processing and augmentation

### Obsidian-Compatible
Uses conventions that work in Obsidian:
- `[[Wiki-style]]` links for cross-referencing
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Tag-based organization
- Graph view of research relationships

### AI-Powered
Designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants:
- Structured formats for easy parsing
- Built-in prompts and workflows
- Tools that enhance (not replace) human insight
