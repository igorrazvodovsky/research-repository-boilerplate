# Research Repository Boilerplate

A starter template for UX research repositories. Part of the [design-kit](https://github.com/igorrazvodovsky/design-kit).

## Philosophy

This boilerplate attempts a **markdown-first approach** to research documentation, enabling:

- Customisation - Each researcher, team, project can adjust the structure to their needs
- Flexibility - There are templates & defaults but everything is text file and can be easily changed, extended or ignored.
- Human-AI collaboration - Work with AI tools directly on your research artifacts
- Knowledge compounding - Build a repository that grows in value over time, feeding insights back into your broader design practice

## Structure

This is tentative—I’ll make it up as I go along.

- Templates - Ready-to-use research document templates organized loosely by process order
- Tools - LLM utilities that automate boring stuff, keep track of things, and suggest next steps
- Projects - Containers for ongoing work
- Knowledge base - Accumulated insights and patterns that create compounding value over time
- Example projects

## (Planned) Features

### Obsidian-compatible

Uses conventions that work in Obsidian:
- `[[Wiki-style]]` links for cross-referencing
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Tag-based organization
- Graph view of research relationships

### Support for entire work of research & researchOps

- Research project phases: question, approach, execution, analysis, synthesis, report
- Standardising methods and supporting documentation to save time and enable consistent application across teams
- Democratisation: information on methods and process paired with their customisation enables non-researchers to do research on their own.

### Coupling with design tools

- Cross-linking with design systems
- Supporting prototyping. E.g. by including the project as a submodule and providing coding agent with research context.

### Coupling with development process & cycle

- IN: roadmap, opportunity trees, problem/solution statements → research question & plan
- OUT: reports & insights → clarity, priorities, recommendations
- Keeping research limited in scope, helping break activities into sprint/cycle efforts
